# Why should I use Jetpack Compose? ðŸ¤”

If we look technically:

- Declarative UI is **_cleaner_**, **_readable_**, and **_performant_** than Imperative UI.
- Compose allows you to do **_more with less code_** compared to XML.
- Compose is **_Intuitive_**. This means that you **_just need to tell_** Compose what you want to show the user.
- Compose is **_compatible_** with all your existing code: you can call Compose code from Views and Views from Compose. Also integrated with many Jetpack Libraries.
- Compose **_improves your build time_** and APK size.
