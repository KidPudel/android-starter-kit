# Why should I use Jetpack Compose? ğŸ¤”

If we look technically:

- Declarative UI is **_cleaner_**, **_readable_**, and **_performant_** than Imperative UI.
- Compose allows you to do **_more with less code_** compared to XML.
- Compose is **_Intuitive_**. This means that you **_just need to tell_** Compose what you want to show the user.
- Compose is **_compatible_** with all your existing code: you can call Compose code from Views and Views from Compose. Also integrated with many Jetpack Libraries.
- Compose **_improves your build time_** and APK size.


# What is it?

> Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android - Google

What once was **View** -> now is **Composable**

# How to start using it?

first add this to `build.gradle`
```kotlin
buildscript {
    ext {
        compose_ui_version = '1.1.1'
    }
}
```

```kotlin
buildFeatures {
  compose true
}
```

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation 'androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.3.1'
  implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:$compose_ui_version"
  implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling-preview:$compose_ui_version"
  implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.1.1'
  
  androidTestImplementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-junit4:$compose_ui_version"
  debugImplementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:$compose_ui_version"
  debugImplementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-manifest:$compose_ui_version"
}
```

# How to use it?

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            ComposeAppTheme {
                // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colors.background
                ) {
                    Greeting("Android")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
now we intead of SetContentView(binding.root), we have SetContent {}

`Greeting("Android")` - this is composable  
it's a function annotated with `@Composable`
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) {
  // Text is also Composable
  Text("Hello, $name")
}
```

- arrangment - is the main axes
- alignment - is the cross axes

for a column we have vertical arrangment and horizontal alignment


# Modifiers

Modifier.:
- `.backgroud` draws a shape with a solid color behind the content
- `.fillMaxSize(->percentage<-), MaxHeight, MaxWidth` scales composable with a percentage of how much is it fill the screen
- `.width, .height, .required_` just as with xml, but required is fill even furthter (can go out of screen)
-  `.padding` pushes content of container inside ([read more about padding](https://github.com/KidPudel/android-starter-kit/blob/main/XML/margin-vs-padding.md))
-  `.offest` like [margin](https://github.com/KidPudel/android-starter-kit/blob/main/XML/margin-vs-padding.md), but it doesn't push other elements (starts from top left corner), but you can use `Spacer` composable (add extra space)
