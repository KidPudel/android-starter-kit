# Result from an Activity

Sometimes we need to **get information from activity**, for example:
> App opens camera, camera takes a photo, and camera activity destroyed, and previous activity need to get that photo

This functionality is provided by **_Activity Result APIs_** introduced in `AndroidX` **Activity** and **Fragment**.
> The Activity Result APIs provide components for **registering** for a result, **launching** the result, and **handling** the result once it is dispatched by the system.
