Process is the self-contained unit of execution that has all thing it needs.
**In short**, the process is the container of the threads, all the necessities for their work, and their shared resources.

**Thread of execution is a stream of instructions inside a process** that can be scheduled and run independently
**Each thread has its executor**, and this executor can perform only one thread at a time
Several threads inside the same process can run concurrently or in parallel.

Workers in a pizzeria play a role of thread executors. Tasks that workers accomplish are the threads in a pizzeria (process)

```kotlin
val thread: Thread = Thread.currentThread() // the current thread
```


- A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be performed in parallel.
- The class ```Thread``` allows working with a thread as an object.
- You can obtain a reference to the currently executing thread using the static method ```Thread.currentThread()```.
- Any thread has a name, an identifier, a priority, as well as isAlive and isDaemon characteristics, which you can change.


# Coroutines

it is similar to threading, except coroutines are even more light-weight. Also, the library (kotlinx.coroutines) is specially designed to make the code similar on different platforms.

> Let's go back to the analogy with a firm. We can compare a coroutine with a usual task that can be done by an employee. First, the task is created, and then assigned to a person. When the person is ready, they decide what to do: start handling the task or transfer it to another person. When someone starts working on the task, there's no guarantee it will be done right away. For example, say the task was to call another department, and the person called but nobody answered. Then that person can "suspend" the task, that is, postpone it for a while. During this gap, the person can take another task and start working on it, or, if there are no more assigned tasks, they can take a break.

- `coroutine` - is an instance of suspendable computation, that is not dependet on any thread, and can switch it as needed, takes a code that run concurrently
- `suspend function` - function that can be paused and resumed



# Create coroutines 

1. Create corutines scope
2. Call coroutine builder `launch`, this will launch coroutine
3. Set a context*
```kotlin
GlobalScope.launch(context) {
}
```

# Context

Context will describe in which thread coroutine will be started

- **Dispatcher.Main** - in a main thread for ui operation in coroutine 
- **.IO** - data operation, networking
- **.Default** - doing complex and doing long operation (operating through list)
- **.Unconfined** - not confined (–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ–Ω) to a specific thread üßµ 
- **newSingleThreadContext(‚ÄúmyThread‚Äù)**

## Switch context

```kotlin
GlobalScope.launch(Dispatcher.IO) {
    val response = networkRequest()
    Changed context to Main ‚¨áÔ∏è
    withContext(Dispatcher.Main) {
         Text.text = response
     }
}
```

## Suspend functions without coroutine

```kotlin
Log.d("before runBlocking")
runBlocking {
    Log.d("start of runBlocking")
    delay(5000)
    Log.d("end of runBlocking")
}
Log.d("after runBlocking")
```
```kotlin
before runBlocking
start of runBlocking
---
delay of 5 seconds
---
end of runBlocking
after runBlocking
```

## Wait, corputine returns something? 

Yes, it returns `Job`

```kotlin
val job = GlobalScope.launch(Dispatcher.Default) {
    repeat(5) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Doing something..")
    }    
}
```
job has some suspend function
- `join` block thread, until coroutine is finished
- `cancel` cancel job, but sometimes you need to check it in coroute with `isActive`, because it can be to busy to check that it's cancled

# Timeout

coroutine has function `withTimeout(timeMills)`, to cancel at some time

# Await Async

if we put 2 suspend function to into coroutine, they will excute **sequentially**..  
To prevent that instead of `.launch` ff
