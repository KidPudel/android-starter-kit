Process is the self-contained unit of execution that has all thing it needs.
**In short**, the process is the container of the threads, all the necessities for their work, and their shared resources.

**Thread of execution is a stream of instructions inside a process** that can be scheduled and run independently
**Each thread has its executor**, and this executor can perform only one thread at a time
Several threads inside the same process can run concurrently or in parallel.

Workers in a pizzeria play a role of thread executors. Tasks that workers accomplish are the threads in a pizzeria (process)
