The Room persistence library provides an **abstraction layer over SQLite** to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:
- Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
- Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
- Streamlined database migration paths.
