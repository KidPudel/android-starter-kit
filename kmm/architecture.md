# Shared code
- share code between all platforms (like buisness logic that applies to all platforms)
- share code among some platforms included in your project, **_but not all_**. when you can reuse in similar plaforms
- to access platform specific API with [expect/actual](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-connect-to-apis.html)

## Share code on all platforms
common logic for all plaforms (ktor, sql delight, etc.) just write in `commonMain`

## Share code among some similar plaforms
You often need a several native targets that could reuse common logic and third-party API.

[Share code among some platforms included](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-share-on-platforms.html#share-code-on-similar-platforms) in your project but not all. You can reuse much of the code in similar platforms using a hierarchical structure. You can use target shortcuts for common combinations of targets or create the hierarchical structure manually.


## Connect to platform-specific api
When developing multiplafrom application that needs to access platform-specific API that implement **required** functionality, there are `expect`/`actual` keywords.

Common source set defines `expect` declaration and platform source sets must provide `actual` declaration that corresponds to the `expected` declaration.  
This works for most kotlin declarations such as: functions, classes, interfaces, enumarations, properties, annotations.

![expect-actual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63263301/228362659-32296733-8e2d-4523-80c4-9abd4c334523.png)

The compiler ensures that for every `expect` declaration in common modules there is `actual` declaration in all platform modules.  
The IDE provides tools that help you create the missing actual declarations.


ðŸŸ¢
> Use `expected` and `actual` declarations **_only for Kotlin declarations that have platform-specific dependencies_**. Implementing as much functionality as possible in the shared module is better, even if doing so takes more time.
Don't overuse expected and actual declarations â€“ in some cases, an interface may be a better choice because it is more flexible and easier to test.
